- Responded to Sir's query about Tokyo weather using the search skill.
- Identified and fixed a bug in the `reminders.delete` skill (missing import of `parseReminderLine`).
- Deleted two test reminders: "Test Recur" (rid_6UGLV2N26UAS) and "Test None" (rid_GASOLIDIGUO4) at Sir's request.
- Verified that the reminders file is now clear of these test entries.
