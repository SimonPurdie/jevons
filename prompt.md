› study docs/SPEC.md

  follow docs/PLAN.md and choose the most important item to address. Complete that item and no other.

  IMPORTANT:
  - After implementing functionality or resolving problems, run the tests for that unit of code that was improved.
  - If functionality is missing then it's your job to add it as per the application specifications.
  - after performing your task run the tests
  - when tests pass, commit to deploy changes

  if you ran into difficulties due to a lack of information about the project or environment, which you then resolved,
  leave a note about it in docs/BREADCRUMBS.md to help future agents. For example, if you run commands multiple times
  before learning the correct command.

  IMPORTANT: keep docs/BREADCRUMBS.md operational only - status updates and progress notes do not belong there.

  Update docs/PLAN.md when the task is done. If you discover issues, immediately update docs/PLAN.md with your
  findings. When resolved, update docs/PLAN.md and remove the item.
